# AgenticPR - Pull Request Intelligence System 🤖

An AI-powered system that intelligently analyzes GitHub pull requests and provides actionable insights in real-time.

## Overview

AgenticPR automates code review workflows by leveraging AI agents to analyze PRs, detect issues, and generate comprehensive reports. It combines a modern React frontend with a sophisticated Python backend powered by LLMs.

### Key Features

- 🔍 **Intelligent PR Analysis**: AI-driven analysis of code changes
- 📊 **Visual Dashboards**: Real-time insights and metrics

3. **Analysis**: AI agents review code and generate insights
4. **Results**: Findings displayed in dashboard
5. **Feedback**: Developer sees recommendations and changes
