An AI-powered system that intelligently analyzes GitHub pull requests and provides actionable insights in real-time.

## Overview

AgenticPR automates code review workflows by leveraging AI agents to analyze PRs, detect issues, and generate comprehensive reports. It combines a modern React frontend with a sophisticated Python backend powered by LLMs.

### Key Features
